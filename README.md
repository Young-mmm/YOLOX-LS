This is the result in the paper "YOLOX–LS: Strong Gravitational Lenses Detection in the DECaLS with Deep Learning".A total of 1697 strong gravitational lens candidates are included, including 303 previous lenses and candidates(6 known lenses and 297 known candidates), and 1394 newly discovered gravitational lens candidates, which include 102 high-quality candidates.
The corresponding included right ascension, declination, photometric redshift, spectroscopic redshift, reference and magnitude information in the g, r, and z bands. 
There are 152 × 152 pixels images synthesized in g, r, and z bands.
The false positive list includes the physical information of 17,442 false positive samples, which can be used by others for training models.
